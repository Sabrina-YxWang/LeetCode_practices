# LeetCode_practices
All the questions are from LeetCode. I usually do 2 practices per week just for... fun I think?
I have consult many online resources including youtube, stack, etc when I could not figure out the question.
I will continue adding refrences both in this file and in the code itself to acknowledge other's contributions.
Also, python is the only language I'm familiar with the most. I will try to optimize every code with other languages.
